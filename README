XTreme-Monitor was a basic project on Google App Engine to support external monitoring of URLs(via HTTP status codes) with configurable alerting thresholds via e-mail.  

We subsequently switched to using Pingdom for monitoring, so this hasn't been modified since 2010.  The code is pretty basic and might be useful for something.

To use:

1. Setup a Google App Engine Account
2. Update your account with this code
3. Use the datastore viewer to add new locations and watchers
4. That's it!
